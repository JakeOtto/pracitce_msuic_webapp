# Now, when we create a test, if we allow it to accept a parameter called
# `db_connection` or `web_client`, Pytest will automatically pass in the objects
# we created above.

# For example:

# def test_something(db_connection, web_client):
#     # db_connection is now available to us in this test.
#     # web_client is now available to us in this test
